          Polyhouse Structure Development
        </h2>
        <p className={service.ssp}>
          {" "}
          caliper Business has shown extraordinary results in setting up poly
          house structures for hydroponics-based farms. Based on particular
          requirements and criteria, two distinct types of temperature
          controlled polyhouse structures are being developed for hydroponics
          farming.

            </h2>
            <p className={service.ssp}>
              Fan & Pad polyhouse is used to control the temperature and
              humidity of the farm as plants require an optimum conditions for
              maximum yield and quality.The internal temperature of the farm can
              be controlled with these fans and pads.
            </p>
            <p className={service.ssp}>
              We install sensors on your farm to monitor and control the farm
              temperature, water temperature, humidity, electrical conductivity,
              pH, TDS, etc. This will help you in better assessment of various
              parameters of your farm.

            <p className={service.ssp}>
              The Naturally Ventilated Polyhouse is developed to solve the
              challenges of ventilation and humidity by achieving optimum air
              exchange while also reducing energy costs utilizing environmental
              controls.

            <p className={service.ssp}>
              Roofs with specialised features are designed to shed rain and
              Increases crop production by providing suitable controlled
              environment and other parameters such as temperature, humidity,
              ventilation, irrigation, Fertigation, and integrated pest
              management are monitored and controlled throughout the season.

            <p className={service.ssp}>
              NFT system or the nutrient film technique is one of the most
              versatile and popular hydroponics systems that use a pump for
              delivering nutrients & water to the crops. There is also a drain
              pipe for recycling unused nutrient rich solutions.
            </p>
            <p className={service.ssp}>
              We at Caliper Business use UPVC pipes that cause no harm to the
              crops and allow them to grow healthily. It is highly suited to
              grow exotic and Indian leafy green crops such as lettuce,
              broccoli, spinach, bok choy, basil, etc.

            <p className={service.ssp}>
              In Deep Water Culture the roots are kept in the nutrient-rich
              solution water for 24/7. This system is highly suited for large
              crops or especially for those with big roots. This system is not
              so costly & less complicated to use.
            </p>
            <p className={service.ssp}>
              In this you can grow crops like head lettuce, kale, okra, large

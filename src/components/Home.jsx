        <h1 className={home.home_div2h}>What is a Hydroponic System?</h1>
        <p>
          New technologies are coming up every day in the world. As the world
          population is growing, the agriculture industry is also developing new
          techniques to grow food in lesser space and by saving water. The
          hydroponic growing system is a step towards this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hydroponic System is a system of growing crops without soil, often
          called soilless farming. In the hydroponic system, the plant roots
          grow in a liquid nutrient solution or inside the moist inert materials
          like Rockwool and Vermiculite. The liquid nutrient solution is a
          mixture of essential plant nutrients in the water.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plant roots are suspended either in the static liquid solution or
          in a continuously flowing nutrient mixture. The hydroponic growing
          system requires continuous attention to the crops, unlike the
          traditional farming system.
        </p>
        <h3>​ Advantages of a hydroponic system</h3>
        <li>
          Higher productivity than the traditional farming system, the plant
          nutrients are effectively used, and there is no wastage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hydroponic system is a controlled climate system in which the
          crops can grow year-round.
        </li>
        <li>
          Water utilization is low when compared to the traditional farming
          method, up to 80-90 percent lower.
        </li>
        <li>
          The crops are grown in a closed space, which eliminates the attack of
          pests and insects.
        </li>
        <h3>Types of hydroponic system</h3>
        <p>
          The growing methods for each type of crop can be different so as the
          hydroponic system. When you are choosing between the various
          hydroponic systems, knowing about the basics of that system will help
          you in making the decision.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Here is a quick go through some of the hydroponic systems:</p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Standing Aerated Nutrient Solution: </h4>
        <p>
          This system is commonly known as DWC (deep water culture) system.
          Standing aerated nutrient solution is a hydroponic system in which the
          nutrient solution is static, suspending the plant roots in the
          nutrient solution. Replacement of nutrient solution is required every
          5 to 10 days (frequency depends on the number of plants and system
          volume).
        </p>
        <p>
          A crop like lettuce can be successfully grown in this system on
          Styrofoam sheets floating on an aerated nutrient solution.
        </p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT):</h4>
        <p>
          Nutrient Film Technique, gully channels are used in this system to
          grow plants, the nutrient solution keeps flowing in these gully
          channels. A pump connected to the reservoir pumps the nutrient
          solution to the NFT channels. One of the advantages of the NFT is the
          easy installation of the system and the relatively low cost of the
          materials.
        </p>
        <p>There are two different types of NFT system:</p>
        <p>1. Horizontal NFT System</p>
        <p>2.Vertical NFT System</p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Aeroponic System:</h4>
        <p>
          Aeroponic System drastically reduces the amount of water used in
          growing crops. In this system, plant roots get their nutrients and
          water through the aerosol mist sprayed on them. Plant roots get the
          oxygen from the air while suspending.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aeroponic System is comparatively challenging to manage but much more
          economical in the use of nutrients and water.
        </p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Dutch Bucket Grow System ​</h4>
        <p>
          As the name is depicting, this system uses buckets to grow plants.
          These buckets can vary in size, depending on the requirement of the
          grower. The bucket has a growing media like vermiculite to support the
          growing plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plants having much larger roots are grown with the help of the Dutch
          Bucket system like tomato and cucumber.
        </p>
        <h3>How much does it cost to set up a Hydroponic farm in one Acre?</h3>
        <p>
          Adaptation of new technologies makes you feel more confident about
          yourself. When it comes to adapt those technologies in the farm
          business, people usually took their foot back. The reason behind this
          is not having precise information about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are thinking of setting up your dream hydroponic farm, we are
          here to assist you in your path of success. We will talk about those
          things here that take up a large part of your investment in the
          hydroponic farm.
        </p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Outer Structure:</h4>
        <p>
          The outer structure of the hydroponic farm provides a protected
          environment for the crops. There are two types of outer structure
          mainly, one is polyhouse type, and the other is the greenhouse type.
          Both the structure has distinct advantages.
        </p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>Growing System: ​</h4>
        <p>
          The growing system depends on the type of plant you want to grow in
          your hydroponic farm. If you are planning to crops like lettuce, kale,
          the NFT system will be suitable, and if you need to grow vegetable
          crops like tomato and cucumber, the Dutch bucket system will be fit.
        </p>
        <h4 className={home.p2}>
          Temperature and Irrigation Controlling System:
        </h4>

        <p>
          The temperature controlling system will maintain an optimum
          temperature for the growth of crops. The irrigation system will
          irrigate or pumps the nutrient solution to the growing system and
          continuously monitors the moisture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The estimated cost of setting up a hydroponic farm in India in
          one-acre will come between Rs. 1.45 Cr to Rs. 1.80 Cr. It is an
          estimated cost and can vary according to your specific choice of
          equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hydroponic farm of one-acre can produce around 90,000 to 95,000
          lettuce plants, that will ensure high profitability. For more detailed
